## AntiCheat ACE Mod
An anti-cheat mod for ACE.

### Features:
- AntiBlink: Detects / prevents moving through closed doors.

### TODO:
- Speed hack / other detection?
- AntiBlink currently doesn't work across landblock boundaries, so there's probably a couple edgecases it fails on.
- AntiBlink should be fast enough, but could use better filtering for doors to check against.
- Configurable way to deal with offenders. Right now it just logs.
